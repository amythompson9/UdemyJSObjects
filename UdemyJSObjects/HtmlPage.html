        Suppose I wanted to model a single person
        name
        age
        city

        perfect case for OBJECT

        always a key/value pair
        objects don't have any built-in order

        var person = {
        name: "Cindy",
        age: 32,
        city: "Missoula"

        }-->
    <!-- Retrieving Data

        you have two choices, bracket and dot notation

        var person = {
            name: "Cindy",
            age: 32,
            city: "Missoula"
        };

        bracket notation, similar to arrays:
        console.log(person["name"]);

        dot notation
        console.log(person.name);

        you cannot use dot notation if the propety starts with a number
        object.1blah is invalid
        object["1blah"] is valid

        you can lookup using a variable with bracket notation
        var str = "name";
        someobject.str doesn't look for name
        someobject[str] finds the name

        you cannot use dot notation for names with sapces
        -->
    <!-- updating data

        acces a property and reassign it

        to update age
        person["age"] += 1
        to update city
        person.city = "London";-->
    
    
    <!-- Creating Objects

        like arrays, there are a few methods of initializing
        objects

        make an empty object and then add to it
        var person = {
            person.name: "Cindy",
            person.age: 32,
            person.city: "Missoula"
        };

        all at once
        var person = {
            person.name: "Cindy",
            person.age: 32,
            person.city: "Missoula"
        };

        another way of initializing an object
        var person = new Object();
        person.name: "Cindy",
        person.age: 32,
        person.city: "Missoula"

        -->

    <!-- objects can hold all sorts of data -->
